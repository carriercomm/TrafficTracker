TrafficTracker
==============


TrafficTracker is a tool for putting your network traffic on a map. It can also provide extra information to the user, i.e. ISPs and DNSs. These details are searched based on the destination IP. 

TrafficTracker uses ip-api.com to search geolocation data about addresses.
